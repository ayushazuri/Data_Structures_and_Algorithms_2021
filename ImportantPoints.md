# Important Points

1. If the question has a O(n2) solution, where j loop is dependent on i loop, There is a very good chance that, that question can be solved in a better way using Stacks.
2. In Heap, when you want to get the smallest number, use max-heap, and vice-versa.
3. Priority queue in java are by default ascending in order, to make it descending, that is, to make a max head, 
   pass a comparator in it and override the function.
   
4. If the array is sorted, then always remember that you can apply Binary Search or Two pointer algorithm to it. So 
   it can be easily solved or can be optimised with the help of them. (Two pointer can be useful at other various 
   places as well)
   
5. Recursion can be solved by 3 methods.
      i) Hypothesis Induction Base condition: Define the function and give it a meaning and with that in mind, 
   design an induction which would give you the solution. Can be done for easy problem.
      ii) Input Output method: Make Recursive Tree. Medium Problem
      ii) Make Choice diagram like in Dynamic Programming. Hard problem.
