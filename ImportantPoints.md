# Important Points

1. If the question has a O(n2) solution, where j loop is dependent on i loop, There is a very good chance that, that question can be solved in a better way using Stacks.
2. In Heap, when you want to get the smallest number, use max-heap, and vice-versa.
3. Priority queue in java are by default ascending in order, to make it descending, that is, to make a max head, 
   pass a comparator in it and override the function.
